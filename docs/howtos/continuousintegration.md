# Continuous Integration

The generator is able to provide build definitions for continuous integration.

List of the pipeline technologies currently supported:
- Azure DevOps (integrated with KarmaJS for test coverage)

## Azure DevOps
The build definition included with your project configures the equivalent of the "Continuous Integration" of the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/toolchain/implement-ci-cd-with-azure-devops).
Once your yaml definition file is committed and pushed, you will see a "name of your repository - CI" build definition appear under the same team project.  
If you want to set up automated deployments of your solution, you can then follow the "Continuous Deployment" section of the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/toolchain/implement-ci-cd-with-azure-devops#continuous-deployment).  
Simply select the new build definition and update the paths to match the artifact name.
