## Basic technologies to know

* [Write your own Yeoman generator](http://yeoman.io/authoring/) - This article provides you with basic insights on how to write a custom Yeoman generator

* [Mocha getting started](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started) - To test that the Yeoman generator is working properly a testing framework named Mocha is used

* [Embedded JavaScript templating](http://ejs.co) - EJS is the core engine used in Yeoman to deploy template files and dynamically embed custom settings in the files getting deployed

## Places to look for help
The JavaScript a Yeoman generator uses is based on Node.js and many things are treated differently than in the JavaScript that exists in browsers.

* [Yeoman API Documentation](http://yeoman.io/generator/) - 
Besides the getting started guide, there is official documentation available that covers the complete Yeoman API

* [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/) -
In general, a Yeoman generator is written in JavaScript but it is based on Node.js where the development patterns are slightly different. In some cases it might be handy to consult the Node.js documentation.
