# PnP SPFx Yeoman generator
The composeability model of Yeoman generators is one of their core features and allow you to build your own or consume and reuse an already built generator. Microsoft's SharePoint Framework Yeoman generator supports this model too.

The PnP SPFx Yeoman generator uses 100% of the Microsoft SPFx Yeoman generator but then adds features on top of this framework.

This extension supports additional client-side libraries such as PnPjs or jQuery to extend SPFx capabilities as well as even more complex extensions such as the integration of HandlebarsJS, VueJS, and many more.

> **Limitation:** Right now the PnP SPFx yeoman generator supports only the initial setup of new projects. To add additional web parts and extensions, please continue to use the Microsoft SPFx generator. In the future, this generator will be used to add elements to existing projects.
