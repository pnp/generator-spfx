# About @pnp/generator-spfx

The composeability model of Yeoman generators is one of their core features and allow you to build your own or consume and reuse an already built generator. Microsoft's SharePoint Framework Yeoman generator supports this model too.

The PnP SPFx Yeoman generator uses 100% of the Microsoft SPFx Yeoman generator but then adds functionalities on top of this framework.
