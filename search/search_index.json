The code for the generator is not written in TypeScript. TypeScript requires compilation to JavaScript. This results would be more complexity and less support from the Yeoman community. To keep it plain and simple - only Node.js is be used for this generator. What is the difference between NodeJS and JavaScript? \u00b6 Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is used to develop backend services, shell scripts, development tools, and many more things. Node.js supports most of the features of the ECMA Script / JavaScript specification. All browsers run JavaScript, but do not always support the latest features of the ECMA Script Specification Do I need to install @microsoft/generator-sharepoint? \u00b6 No - The PnP SPFx generator has a dependency on a specific version of @microsoft/generator-sharepoint. This version will be automatically installed with the npm package of this generator. Can I have different versions of @microsoft/generator-sharepoint installed? \u00b6 Yes, you can, for example, have version 1.4.1 installed manually on your machine.

The following sections explain the overall setup and considerations. Project Setup \u00b6 The following directory listing gives you an overview of the main directories in the generator: \u251c\u2500\u2500 app <-- Main Generator \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs <-- Documentation \u251c\u2500\u2500 generators <-- Custom Generators \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 addons <-- Addon Generator reserved for client libraries only \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 handlebars <-- PnP Handlebars generator \u251c\u2500\u2500 lib <-- General purpose libraries \u251c\u2500\u2500 test <-- Mocha Unit Tests \u251c\u2500\u2500 tools \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 generator-template <-- Template yeoman generator Getting started writing a new generator \u00b6 To get started implementing and adding a new generator, copy the template folder in the generators folder and rename it to a meaningful name matching your framework. In the folder you will find the following files: index.js - main sub generator file promptconfig.js - special prompt config related to sub generator template/addonConfig.json - This file contains all NPM Packages that need to be installed User prompt for sub generator \u00b6 If your generator needs some additional information from the user, questions can be configured in the file promptconfig.js . The content of this file follows the default Yeoman generator user prompting described in the article Interacting with the User . The library Yeoman uses is Inquirer.js . \"use strict\" // These are just sample selection of options const options = [{ name : 'Option A' , value : 'option-a' }, { name : 'Option B' , value : 'option-b' } ]; const configOptions = [ // Sample content of questions { type : 'list' , message : 'Please add your options in here' , name : 'youroptions' , choices : options } // , addon ] const promptConfig = { config : configOptions } module . exports = promptConfig ; This example exports the configuration as a module and can be integrated in the main Yeoman generator to consolidate the user prompts in the main generator. Generator implementation - index.js \u00b6 All actions required for a new custom generator need to be implemented in the index.js file. The default template currently lists all possible methods in the correct call order provided by the default Yeoman generator: // Base Yeoman generator const Generator = require ( 'yeoman-generator' ); // prompt configuration const prompts = require ( './promptConfig' ); module . exports = class extends Generator { constructor ( args , opts ) { super ( args , opts ); // configuration of user prompt } // Initialisation geenerator initializing () { } // Prompt for user input for Custom Generator prompting () { } // adds additonal editor support in this case CSS Comb configuring () { // Currently not supported - Don't use this } // adds additonal editor support in this case CSS Comb writing () { // Currently not supported - Don't use this } // adds additonal editor support in this case CSS Comb install () { /** * Place your custom deployment code in here */ } // Run installer normally time to say goodbye // If yarn is installed yarn will be used end () { } } The call order of a Yeoman generator is defined in the following steps: constructor() initializing() prompting() configuring() writing() install() end() Because of the dependency on the Microsoft Yeoman Generator, the actions need to be delayed to the next step. After the SPFx generator has written the files to the file system through its writing() method, the custom generator is able to update the configuration with additional information. Instead of adding the code of the custom generator to the writing() method, the code has to be added to the install() method. In the case of the Handlebars generator, the following functions get called in the install() method: install () { // deploy additional files to the project directory this . _deployFiles (); // add externals to the configuration this . _addExternals (); // add all package depenedencies configured in addonConfig.json. this . _addPackageDependencies (); // inject custom tasks to gulpfile this . _injectToGulpFile (); // finally run install util . runInstall ( this ); } This is required because all additional tasks have to be performed on top of the assets deployed by the SPFx default assets.

If the yarn package manager is installed on the client, this package manager will instead be used by default. The pnpm package manager is available via a command line switch when the yeoman generator gets launched. To install dependencies with a specific package manager, the following options exist: To explicitly use npm: yo @pnp/spfx --pm npm or yo @pnp/spfx --package-manager npm To explicitly use pnpm: yo @pnp/spfx --pm pnpm or yo @pnp/spfx --package-manager pnpm To explicitly use pnpm: yo @pnp/spfx --pm yarn or yo @pnp/spfx --package-manager yarn","title":"Default behaviour of the installer"},{"location":"recipes/run-install/#reference-to-the-util","text":"Your generators index.js should include the following line of code somewhere at the start: // importing utilities const util = require ( '../../lib/util.js' );","title":"Reference to the Util"},{"location":"recipes/run-install/#call-npm-package-installation","text":"Add the following line of code in the install method of your generator: install (){ /* Custom configuration code should be placed before the installer */ util . runInstall ( this ); }","title":"Call npm package installation"},{"location":"tools/util/","text":"Util - Overview \u00b6 The util module can be found in the './lib/' directory and contains the following methods. mergeAddons(addonConfig, requestedLibraries, config) \u00b6 This method merges add-ons in package.json . addonConfig Configuration of add-ons available in the generator. requestedLibraries Array of requested library identifiers. config Given configuration to merge add-ons in the currently used package.json , for example. composeGulpFile(coreTemplate, customTemplate) \u00b6 This method allows you to inject custom gulp tasks in the gulp file. coreTemplate Path to any gulp file you would like to use as a template. customTemplate Contains all your custom gulp tasks you would like to inject.
